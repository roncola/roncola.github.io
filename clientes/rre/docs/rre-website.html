## Development Notes
Pug/CoffeeScript/SASS compiling is handled by Prepros.
Dependencies are handled by Bower. It's very important to note that if a dependency is not handled by Bower, its public GitHub/BitBucket repo should be used instead.

**DO NOT** stick dependencies under `/css` and `/js`

## Deployment Notes
Prepros takes care of deployment, as long as `bower install` has been run at least once on the project folder.

Once you're confident with your 'Live Preview', simply use Prepros' built-in FTP/SFTP upload to update the live site.
